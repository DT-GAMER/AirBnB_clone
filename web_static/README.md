## AirBnB Clone - Web Static
## Web Static, What?
Now that I have a command interpreter for managing my AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, I will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

Create simple HTML static pages
Style guide
Fake contents
No Javascript
No data loaded from anything
During this project, I learnt how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of my page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of my page, the design. I was encouraged to fix my HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, I can’t apply any design.
